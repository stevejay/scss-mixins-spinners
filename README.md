# scss-mixins-spinners

Performant pure CSS spinners implemented as SCSS mixins. See [here](http://www.perspectivespace.com/scss-mixins-spinners/) for examples.

All animations are implemented using transform or opacity animations in
order that the browser only needs to use compositing to update the DOM,
rather than requiring painting or layout calls as well.

The spinners can all be customized in various ways.

## Examples

See [here](http://www.perspectivespace.com/scss-mixins-spinners/) for examples
