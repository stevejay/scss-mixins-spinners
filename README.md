# scss-mixins-spinners

Performant pure CSS spinners implemented as SCSS mixins. See [here](http://www.perspectivespace.com/scss-mixins-spinners/) for examples.

All animations are implemented using transform or opacity animations in
order that the browser only needs to use compositing to update the DOM,
so no painting or layout calls are required.

The spinners can all be customized in various ways.

## Examples

See [here](http://www.perspectivespace.com/scss-mixins-spinners/) for examples
of the available spinners.
